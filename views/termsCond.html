            Movify provides a personalized subscription service that allows our
            members to access entertainment content (&quot;Movify content&quot;)
            over the Internet on certain Internet-connected TVs, computers and
            other devices (&quot;Movify ready devices&quot;).
          </p>
          <p>
            These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. As used in these
            Terms of Use, &quot;Movify service&quot;, &quot;our service&quot; or
            &quot;the service&quot; means the personalized digital content
            service provided by Movify for discovering and accessing Movify
            content, including all features and functionalities, recommendations
            and reviews, our websites, and user interfaces, as well as all

                <strong>Membership</strong> <br /><br />1.1. Your Movify
                membership will continue until terminated. To use the Movify
                service you must have Internet access and a Movify ready device,
                and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. &quot;Payment
                Method&quot; means a current, valid, accepted method of payment,
                as may be updated from time to time, and which may include
                payment through your account with a third party. Unless you
                cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize
                us to charge the subscription fee for the next billing cycle to
                your Payment Method (see &quot;Cancellation&quot; below).

                <br /><br />1.2. We may offer a number of subscription plans,
                including subscription plans that contain commercial breaks and
                other types of commercial messages ('Advertisements'). Please
                note that our subscription plans without Advertisements may
                still contain limited commercial content, such as branded
                content or sponsorship messaging. In addition, we may give our
                users the opportunity to watch live or special events (including
                replays of such content) or to enjoy new additional features.
                Such content and new features may contain Advertisements
                independent of your subscription plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                1.3. Some subscriptions are offered by third parties in
                conjunction with the provision of their own products and
                services. In addition, some subscription plans may have
                differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at
                your sign-up or in other communications made available to you.
                You can find specific details regarding your Movify subscription
                by visiting the Movify.com website and clicking on the
                &quot;Account&quot; link available at the top of the pages under
                your profile name.<br />

                <strong>Promotional Offers.</strong> We may from time to time
                offer special promotional offers, plans or memberships
                ('Offers'). Offer eligibility is determined by Movify at its
                sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke an Offer and
                put your account on hold in the event that we determine you are
                not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent
                Movify membership may not be eligible for certain introductory
                Offers. We may use information such as device ID, method of
                payment or an account email address used with an existing or
                recent Movify membership to determine Offer eligibility. The
                eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions
                will be disclosed when you sign-up for the Offer or in other
                communications made available to you.

                  <br /></strong
                ><br />3.1. <span class="underline">Billing Cycle.</span> The
                subscription fee for the Movify service will be charged to your
                Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the
                &quot;Account&quot; page. The length of your billing cycle will
                depend on the type of subscription plan that you choose when you
                signed up for the service. In some cases your payment date may
                change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully
                settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid
                subscription began on a day not contained in a given month.
                Visit the Movify.com website and click on the &quot;Billing
                details&quot; link on the &quot;Account&quot; page to see your
                next payment date. If you signed up for Movify using your
                account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the
                billing information about your Movify subscription by visiting
                your account with the applicable third party. <br /><br />3.2.
                <span class="underline">Payment Methods.</span> To use the
                Movify service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You
                authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your
                account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no
                longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You
                remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is
                not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds,
                or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend
                your access to the service until we have successfully charged a
                valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may
                charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or
                other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method.
                Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used.
                Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.

                <br /><br />3.3.
                <span class="underline">Updating your Payment Methods.</span>
                You can update your Payment Methods by going to the
                &quot;Account&quot; page. We may also update your Payment
                Methods using information provided by the payment service
                providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to
                charge the applicable Payment Method(s).
                <br /><br />3.4.
                <span class="underline">Cancellation.</span> You can cancel your
                Movify membership at any time, and you will continue to have
                access to the Movify service through the end of your billing
                period. Payments are non-refundable and we do not provide
                refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or unused
                Movify content. To cancel, go to the &quot;Account&quot; page
                and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your
                membership, your account will automatically close at the end of
                your current billing period. To see when your account will
                close, click &quot;Billing details&quot; on the
                &quot;Account&quot; page. If you signed up for Movify using your
                account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to
                cancel your Movify membership, you may need to do so through
                such third party, for example by visiting your account with the
                applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or
                unsubscribing from the Movify service through that third party.

                  >Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans.</span
                >
                We may change our subscription plans and the price of our
                service from time to time. We will notify you at least one month
                before any price changes or changes to your subscription plan
                will become effective. If you do not wish to accept the price
                change or change to your subscription plan, you can cancel your
                membership before the change takes effect.

                <strong>Movify Service <br /></strong><br />4.1. You must be at
                least 18 years of age to become a member of the Movify service.
                Minors may only use the service under the supervision of an
                adult. <br /><br />4.2. The Movify service and any content
                accessed through the service are for your personal and
                non-commercial use only and may not be shared with individuals
                beyond your household unless otherwise allowed by your
                subscription plan. During your Movify membership we grant you a
                limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access the
                Movify service and Movify content. Except for the foregoing, no
                right, title or interest shall be transferred to you. You agree
                not to use the service for public performances.<br /><br />4.3.
                You may access the Movify content primarily within the country
                in which you have established your account and only in
                geographic locations where we offer your subscription plan and
                have licensed such content. The content that may be available
                will vary by geographic location and will change from time to
                time. Not all Movify content may be available in the ad
                supported subscription plan. The number of devices on which you
                may simultaneously watch depends on your chosen subscription
                plan and is specified on the &quot;Account&quot; page.<br /><br />4.4.
                The Movify service, including the content library, is regularly
                updated. In addition, we continually test various aspects of our
                service, including our websites, user interfaces and promotional
                features. You can turn off test participation at any time by
                visiting the &quot;Account&quot; page and changing the
                &quot;Test participation&quot; settings.

                <br /><br />4.5. Depending on your subscription plan, some
                Movify content may be available for temporary download and
                offline viewing on certain supported devices (&quot;Offline
                Titles&quot;). Limitations apply, including restrictions on the
                number of Offline Titles per account, the maximum number of
                devices that can contain Offline Titles, the time period within
                which you will need to begin viewing Offline Titles and how long
                the Offline Titles will remain accessible. Some Offline Titles
                may not be playable in certain countries and if you go online in
                a country where you would not be able to stream that Offline
                Title, the Offline Title will not be playable while you are in
                that country. <br /><br />4.6. Except as explicitly authorized
                by us, you agree not to:
              </p>

                through the Movify service;

                (ii) circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade, block,

                interface, any advertising or advertising features, copyright
                notices, and trademarks;
              </p>
              <p>
                (iii) use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to
                access the Movify service;
              </p>

                (iv) decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any software or

              <p>
                (vi) use any data mining, data gathering or extraction method;

                functionality of any computer software or hardware or
                telecommunications equipment associated with the Movify service,
                including any software viruses or any other computer code, files
                or programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may terminate or restrict your use of our service if you
                violate these Terms of Use or are engaged in illegal or
                fraudulent use of the service.<br />

                <br />4.7. The quality of the display of the Movify content may
                vary from device to device, and may be affected by a variety of
                factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through
                and/or speed of your Internet connection. HD, Ultra HD and HDR
                availability is subject to your Internet service and device
                capabilities. Not all content is available in all formats, such
                as HD, Ultra HD and HDR, and not all subscription plans allow
                you to receive content in all formats. The minimum connection
                speed for HD video quality (defined as a resolution of 720p or
                higher) is 3.0 Mbps per stream; however, we recommend a faster
                connection for improved video quality. A connection speed of at
                least 5.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive Full HD
                video quality (defined as a resolution of 1080p or higher). A
                connection speed of at least 15.0 Mbps per stream is recommended
                to receive Ultra HD video quality (defined as a resolution of 4K
                or higher). You are responsible for all Internet access charges.
                Please check with your Internet provider for information on
                possible Internet data usage charges. The time it takes to begin
                watching Movify content will vary based on a number of factors,
                including your location, available bandwidth at the time, the
                content you have selected and the configuration of your Movify
